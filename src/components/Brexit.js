              <b>What is Brexit?</b>
            </h1>
            <p>
              The United Kingdom(UK) voted to leave the European Union(EU) which
              occurred on January 31, 2020.
            </p>
            <p>Br(itish) + Exit = Brexit</p>
            <p>
              Both sides agreed that life would remain the same until December
              31, 2020 meaning the UK would still follow the EU rules
            </p>
            <p>
              During this transition period, a deal between the leaders of the
              UK and the EU was meant to be made
            </p>
            <p>
              Luckily, if a deal isnâ€™t agreed upon by December 31, 2020 that
              doesn't mean a deal will never be made. However, the problems that
              may arise will make that necessary deal agreement take place
              sooner.

              <b>Why did Brexit occur?</b>
            </h1>
            <p>
              The Uk joined the European Economic Community (the precursor of
              the EU) on January 1, 1973.
            </p>
            <p>
              The UK would remain a member for 47 years, a very long
              relationship. So why leave? Three factors came into play:
            </p>
            <p>
              Economics - The EU is thought to be a dysfunctional Economic
              Entity
            </p>
            <p>Sovereignty - Due to the rise of nationalism across the world</p>
            <p>
              Political Elitism - The vote to leave, was a vote against the
              British Elite.
